# ☁️ Backend Web API – Built With ASP.NET Core & Clean Architecture

This fullstack project focuses on building a well-structured, scalable API using ASP.NET Core, C#, and SQL Server. With an emphasis on clean code, architecture patterns, and testing, the project demonstrates how to create robust backend solutions ready for production environments.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This API handles:
- CRUD operations for core entities like products, categories, and ingredients
- Validation, versioning, and documentation of endpoints
- Secure and maintainable backend logic
- Scalable architecture using modern design patterns

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me:
- Strengthen my backend development skills in C# and .NET
- Structure scalable APIs using CQRS, MediatR, and the Repository Pattern
- Manage database design, migrations, and advanced LINQ queries with EF Core
- Implement Swagger documentation and versioning for APIs
- Write unit and integration tests with xUnit and mocking frameworks
- Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions

---

## 🔐 Backend Architecture

The API is built using the following tools and principles:

- **ASP.NET Core & C#** – building RESTful APIs with routing, middleware, and DI  
- **Entity Framework Core** – querying and migrating SQL Server databases  
- **MediatR & CQRS** – for separating business logic and enabling maintainability  
- **Repository Pattern** – abstracting data access and improving testability  
- **AutoMapper** – mapping between domain models and view models  
- **FluentValidation** – handling request validation cleanly and declaratively

---

## 🧱 Database & Schema

- **SQL Server** – relational DB used for structured data  
- Designed normalized schemas (e.g., `Product`, `Category`, `Ingredient`)  
- Managed schema updates and data integrity using EF Core migrations

---

## 📡 API Features

- RESTful API with proper HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)  
- API versioning to support future upgrades  
- OpenAPI docs with Swagger, customized for clarity  
- Centralized error handling with meaningful status codes

---

## 🧪 Testing & Reliability

- Unit testing of business logic (commands, handlers, queries) using **xUnit**  
- Integration tests for database + API interaction  
- Mocking frameworks for isolating test dependencies

---

## ⚙️ DevOps & Deployment

- **Git** for version control  
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD  
- Ready to deploy to cloud or on-prem environments

---

## 📦 Other Highlights

- Pagination and filtering for large datasets (`SearchBakeryProductQuery`)  
- Custom reusable extensions (e.g., `PaginationExtension`)  
- HTTPS enforcement and HSTS for secure communication  
- Clear documentation for API setup and usage

---

## 🛍️ Domain Knowledge

This project simulates a small e-commerce backend and includes:
- Inventory and pricing logic  
- Category management  
- View Models like `BakeryProductViewModel`, `BakeryCategoryViewModel` to shape data for client-side use
